                <p class="text-center text-light">I am Christian Terpstra, class of 2027 at Lane Tech High 
                  School. I have two brothers who live in Oregon with my Dad and stepmom. I like 
                  to play soccer and play for a team called Chicago Fire.  I used to play chess when I was younger and actually played in 
                  a tournament. I also love to ski and have been to Mt. Bachelor and Big Sky which
                  are big time resorts and were tons of fun. I've been skiing since I was 3 and instantly
                  loved it. It is my top favorite thing to do in the winter with my family and friends.
                  When I go to Oregon I love to spend time with my little brothers. The older of the two
                  is 4 years old and looks up to me. I'm very glad that he looks up to me which forces me 
                  to become a better brother, and overall a better person.</p>

                          detail of what I want to do later in life and where I want to go 
                          to achieve that. In order to get into the job sector of mechanical
                          engineering you have to have a lot of knowledge in order to get into
                          it. Mechanical engineers design power-producing machines, such as 
                          electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas
                          turbines, as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and
                          air-conditioning systems. Mechanical engineers design other machines
                          inside buildings, such as elevators and escalators. 
                          to see the colleges that offer
                          mechanical engineering.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-center">Some of my hobbies
                          include soccer, skiing, and spending time with family. I play on a 
                          soccer team called Chicago Fire and we travel a lot for soccer. It is 
                          very fun and I have made a lot of memories from this team. Another 
                          hobby of mine that I have is skiing and I have been many places where 
                          skiing is great. I've been to Big Sky and Mount Bachelor which was very 
                          fun and I wish I could be in the mountains right now. My last hobby is 
                          spending time with family because my family can be very unpredictable 
                          which makes that the fun part. Even though I might not go pro, playing 
                          right now, is creating memories forever.</p>
