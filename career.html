                        this college have an option in mechanical engineering, it is also close to my 
                        dad’s house where he lives in Oregon. It would be very fun to go somewhere far 
                        from home to go to college and be close to my dad’s side of the family. Other 
                        than going to Stanford for academic purposes, I know Stanford has a very warm
                        environment and is very welcoming. In the winter, I also love to ski and California
                        is close to all of the good resorts. Therefore, there are many reasons that are 
                        driving my attention towards Stanford for the future.</p>

                      on the East Coast which is a very welcoming environment and I 
                      have someone close that goes to Boston University which is very 
                      important to me. My friend’s dad also went to MIT which is very cool
                      and he does very well for himself. I also have been to the East
                      Coast and I had lots of fun and going to college on the East Coast
                      would allow me to explore more of the East Coast and also visit my 
                      close family friend. Therefore, there are many reasons that drive 
                      my attention towards MIT and I think that it would be a very cool 
                      experience for myself. </p>

                <p class="text-center">I do see myself in this career because my dad is somewhat involved in 
                  this career and it also seems right. I did some camps over the summer 
                  and I am also doing another one over the summer next year. I do understand
                  that there are other options in this field but at my camps it didn’t feel
                  right. Mechanical engineering was the one I had the most fun in and was the
                  most enjoyable.</p>
